Hi, I’m Cody.

My journey into software development started with a simple decision—after reading about what a Computer Engineer does, I decided to pursue it at university, and I’ve never looked back.
Early on, I discovered my passion for Python and Django, which naturally led me into the world of backend development and systems design.
Over time, I found my sweet spot in infrastructure and automation—a perfect blend of software and systems that bridges the gap between Computer Engineering and Software Engineering.

Today, I’m a Staff Engineer working at Parse.ly, where I focus on creating systems that are not only robust but also developer-friendly.
Whether it’s working with legacy systems or optimizing modern platforms, I thrive on tackling complex, technical problems.

I streamline software development and deployment processes while reducing time to market.
My deep passion for automation helps teams reduce bottlenecks, improve system reliability, and focus more on innovation.
I’m always seeking to learn new technologies and stay ahead of trends in infrastructure and DevOps.
